      "6. In demand paging, the pages of a process which are least used, get stored in the secondary memory.\n",
      "7. A page is copied to the main memory when its demand is made, or page fault occurs. There are various\n",
      "page replacement algorithms which are used to determine the pages which will be replaced.\n",
      "8. Rather than swapping the entire process into memory, we use Lazy Swapper. A lazy swapper never\n",

      "the term Swapper is technically incorrect. A swapper manipulates entire processes, whereas a Pager is\n",
      "concerned with individual pagdes of a process.\n",
      "10. How Demand Paging works?\n",
      "a. When a process is to be swapped-in, the pager guesses which pages will be used.\n",
      "b. Instead of swapping in a whole process, the pager brings only those pages into memory. This,\n",

      "it avoids reading into memory pages that will not be used anyway.\n",
      "c. Above way, OS decreases the swap time and the amount of physical memory needed.\n",
      "d. The valid-invalid bit scheme in the page table is used to distinguish between pages that are\n",
      "C\n",
      "in memory and that are on the disk.\n",
      "i. Valid-invalid bit 1 means, the associated page is both legal and in memory.\n",
      "ii. Valid-invalid bit 0 means, the page either is not valid (not in the LAS of the process)\n",
      "or is valid but is currently on the disk.\n",
      "p\n",
      "l\n",
      "e\n",
      "e.\n",
      "f. If a process never attempts to access some invalid bit page, the process will be executed\n",
      "successfully without even the need pages preHsent in the swap space.\n",
      "g. What happens if the process tries to access a page that was not brought into memory, access\n",
      "to a page marked invalid causes page fault. Paging hardware noticing invalid bit for a\n",
      "demanded page will cause a trap to the OS.\n",

      "i. Check an internal tabele (in PCB of the process) to determine whether the reference\n",

      "d\n",
      "If ref. is valid, pager will swap-in the page.\n",

      "v. oWhen disk read is complete, we modify the page table that, the page is now in\n",
